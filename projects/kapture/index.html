<h2>Gesture-based Whiteboard Capture using the Microsoft Kinect</h2>
<img src="poster.png" alt="Poster" border="1">
<p>Kapture is a system which uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to track a person using a whiteboard during a meeting and capture images of the board when they perform certain hand gestures. The images are shared with others present at the meeting by cross-referencing a Google Calendar. All captured images are also stored and made available for easy viewing in a web browser alongside details of the meeting.</p>
<p>It was developed for my Honours project at the University of St Andrews, for which I was nominated as a finalist in the ScotlandIS Young Software Engineer of the Year Awards 2013.</p>
